					<description><![CDATA[I skimmed through the article, interesting stuff but at this stage it looks like a theoretical approach rather than something concrete in software.  It might be that this can result in some form of AI system, but that might well be years away - if I missed something in this regard, feel free to point it out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The continuity thing hits the nail on the head. London you is you in the sense that he shares all your memories. That&#039;s not so easy to dismiss. He thinks he&#039;s just as much you as you think you&#039;re you. And he&#039;s no less you than the you a few years into the future is you, indeed he may be more you than future you. I think there&#039;s a connotation in &quot;replica&quot; that is unwarranted - which is that a replica is some sort of imposter, it&#039;s not. Both you have equal claim to you. Let&#039;s say 10 years ago you were a leftist and now you&#039;re a hardcore conservative. If you got unstuck in time like Billy Pilgrim and could travel to the you of 10 years ago would you still be a conservative or would you be a leftist again? You&#039;d be a leftist again. We&#039;re stuck in time in the same way that we&#039;re stuck in our meat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Copernicus and Galileo, however, were able to deliver the goods and provide compelling evidence for their theories. When it comes to extraterrestrial life existing at this very moment in time, we have zero compelling evidence. The view that &quot;Well, there are billions and billions of stars out there, so naturally life must exist elsewhere right now&quot; takes faith and belief. Which, ironically, is all the opponents of Copernicus and Galileo had also.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t need to &quot;imagine infinity.&quot; Let go of the need for limits, start points, end points and other comparative references that is conditioned by societies living in a finite domain.

Tim&#039;s &quot;there is no way the human brain is built to withstand spans of time like that&quot; exemplifies that conditioning. Of course no human &lt;i&gt;brain&lt;/i&gt; will withstand a span of time even marginally longer than the one it is built for. But there is no reason a &lt;i&gt;mind&lt;/i&gt; must accept limits. The fright it feels when confronted with the possibility no limits is of external origin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About a different approach:
Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System by Pei Wang
https://web.archive.org/web/20180417052338/https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/EBook

More formal specification:
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.800.77%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjt1-2v6OPoAhVwMewKHXZvBF4QFjALegQICBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw10xtDNVuN2dhSdP0Vq5Jn5

What do you think of this?
In my Googling to find interesting AGI projects, I could barely find any.
I found this one though.
I cannot judge how good it really is.
If it&#039;s really promissing, than why is there not even a Wikipedia page of this?
Still it made sense to me so far (read the first link for 50%, second for 25%).
I am not in any way involved in this, just interested.
Leave a reply if you want to have further talk (I replied as guest).]]></description>
